   - **Financial Status**: Predict their financial situation, including savings, debt, and overall stability, based on their answers to questions 4 (savings), 5 (spending), and 6 (debt). Provide an estimated savings amount if possible.
   - **Career and Lifestyle**: Predict their career progress and overall lifestyle, considering their answers to questions 7 (career goal), 8 (work hours), 9 (goal setting), and 10 (optimism). Discuss work-life balance and fulfillment.
2. Use a motivational and realistic tone, speaking directly to the user as if guiding them toward a better future.
